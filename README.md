# 2-5-TemperatureConversion
***
##Simple Temperature Conversion Program  
  
Purpose: convert one farenheit value to celcius then convert one celcius to farenheit.
***
1.  create a new Java project called TemperatureConversion
2.  add a new class to the project called TemperatureConversion with Main
3.  import the scanner class
4.  print a statement informing which conversion you are doing
5.  ask for the temperature
6.  convert the temperature using one of the following formulas:
...Temperature in Celsius = (Temperature in Fahrenheit â€“ 32)*5/9
...Temperature in Fahrenheit = (Temperature in Celsius*9/5)+32
7.  Print the converted temperature (formated with text to identify units)
8.  do the process for the other conversion
9.  don't forget to close the scanner
---
10. Test your program and make certain that it works correctly (dont' worry about invalid inputs)

...32 F is 0 C
...212 F is 100 C
...75 F is 23.889 C (to three decimal places of precision)
...-40 F is also -40 C
